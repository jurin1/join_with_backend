This right to complain exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

<h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>

<h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do so, you can contact us at any time. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
  <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
